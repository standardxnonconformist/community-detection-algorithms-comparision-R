# Comparative Analysis of Community Detection Algorithms on Real, Artificial and Random Datasets using R
A summary of the work done for the June 2021 FOSSEE Research Internship in R. For a brief overview of the work done, check https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/08/a-comparative-analysis-of-community-detection-algorithms/. 

Includes the R files used to perform community detection on the Zachary dataset, a random dataset and an LFR benchmark dataset generated, along with the project report. 

The code for the LFR benchmark can be accessed here: https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/LFR-Benchmark_UndirWeightOvp.
